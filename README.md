                  ** A data analyzed for MoonLight Energy Solutions**                 
                              ** Introduction **
The data, provided by Moonlight Energy Solutions, offers insights into critical factors such as 
energy production, environmental conditions, and operational performance across these regions. 
Through detailed analysis, this report addresses the challenges of location variability, resource 
allocation, and environmental adaptability to identify the area with the highest potential for 
successful solar energy implementation. 
By evaluating the data and presenting key findings, this report provides actionable 
recommendations to guide Moonlight Energy Solutions in making data-driven decisions for 
advancing their renewable energy initiatives.


**This report contains the following terms**
  
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
**Summary Statistics:** Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard 
deviation, and range were calculated for each feature (e.g., GHI, DNI, wind 
speed, temperature). 

**Visualizations:** Various charts and graphs were created to visualize trends and 
distributions of key variables. These included histograms, box plots, and scatter 
plots for the irradiance, temperature, wind, and precipitation data. 

**Correlation Analysis **A correlation matrix was constructed to understand 
relationships between variables, particularly how environmental factors like 
temperature, humidity, and wind speed might influence energy production (e.g., 
GHI and DNI).

In the report I have analysed every metric on the given data that can influence solar farming which are:-

A,**analysis of GHI(Global horizontal irradiance)**

The analysis reveals that there is no significant difference in the distribution of the Global 
Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) across the three countries (Benin, Togo, and Sierra Leone). This 
indicates that solar radiation levels, as represented by GHI, are relatively consistent across these 
regions, suggesting that solar energy potential may not vary dramatically in terms of overall 
radiation. 

B,**The analysis of DNI(Direct Normal Irradiance)**

  The analysis indicates that the Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) distribution shows no significant 
difference across the three countries: Benin, Togo, and Sierra Leone. This finding suggests that 
the direct component of solar radiation, which is crucial for certain solar technologies like 
concentrated solar power (CSP), is relatively uniform across these regions. 

C,**Analysis of DHI( Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance)**

The analysis reveals that the Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI) is slightly higher in Sierra 
Leone compared to Benin and Togo. This indicates that a greater proportion of solar radiation in 
Sierra Leone comes from scattered or indirect sunlight, which is particularly relevant for regions 
with frequent cloud cover or atmospheric scattering.

D,**Distribution of ModA and ModB**

The analysis indicates that the distribution of ModA and ModB values is slightly higher in Sierra Leone 
compared to Benin and Togo. This suggests that the specific modules or sensors associated with 
ModA and ModB records higher readings in Sierra Leone, potentially reflecting differences in 
environmental conditions, solar module performance, or measurement calibration in that region.

E,**Distribution of Tamb**

 Based on the distributions 
Sierra Leone is the best choice for solar farming because 
It has the narrowest spread, meaning the ambient temperature remains stable and within the 
optimal range (~20–30°C). 
Stability reduces the risks of efficiency loss due to high heat or extreme cold, ensuring consistent 
energy production. 
If there are additional factors like solar radiation or land availability, those should also be 
considered before finalizing the decision. 

   **Conclusion** 
Based on the analysis of the above key factors including barometric pressure (BP), wind 
direction (WD), wind gusts (WSgust), wind speed standard deviation (WSstdev), relative 
humidity (RH), and ambient temperature (Tamb), it can be concluded that Sierra Leone is the 
most suitable choice for solar farming.
